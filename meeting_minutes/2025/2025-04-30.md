- Issue [#899](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/899)
  - Thomas Schmidt mentions the task assigned to Christian from March meeting to look for open source tools for grammar check.
  - As there are tools available, Thomas makes the suggestion that we should add an "informative" test
  - Sergii and Denny clarifies that the proposal is not for a specific tool, but that there are tools avaible to conduct the test.
  - Christian asks if this can be merged into the same test that does the spell check?
  - Thomas wants to keep the tests for spell check and grammar check separate as they might have different dependencies.

  - Denny seconded. No disccusion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Issue [#963](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/963)
  - Christian Banse presents the idea of leap seconds and should we be compliant with RFC 3339.
  - Sergii mentions finding ISO 8601 very useful for precision.
  - Denny suggests that it is best to avoid leap seconds completely, and while there are good intentions behind the RFC 3339 that this is a case where implementation of the standard may be impractical.
  - Denny suggests prohibiting leap seconds.
  - Denny mentions in the timing community there is an argument against leap seconds and that there are other approaches being considered.
  - JD and Christoph agree with Denny's suggestion.
  - Christian Banse sets the motion to forbid the use of leap seconds in CSAF v2.1.
  - Denny seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Issue [#917](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/917)
  - Thomas Schmidt presents the issue that states the need to change the name of "informative" tests.
  - Denny does not think "informative" is bad.
  - Thomas says it could be close to "normative" and could be confusing.
  - Sergii suggests "guardrails" test which is a popular wording to use currently.
  - Denny mentions "educational" tests as an option.
  - JD suggest "functional" tests.
  - Sergii suggests "sanity" tests.
  - Christian suggests even though we changed "optional" tests to "recommended" tests, it might make sense to change "informative" tests to "optional" tests.
  - Christian also points out that this could be confusing as each "informative" tests mentions recommendations.
  - JD mentions RFC 2119 and would it make sense for "informative" tests to be changed to "recommended" tests.
  - Thomas clarifies that "optional" tests (now "recommended" tests per earlier motion) and "informative" tests are different, and the use of the language SHOULD (for "optional"/"recommended") and MAY ("informative").
  - Christian suggests that if we were to change the name of "informative" we should also change the recommendations section to guidance or something like that.
  - Denny suggests we table the discussion and revisit at the next meeting.
