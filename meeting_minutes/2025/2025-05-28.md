## Meeting Notes

- Omar Santos call the meeting to order.
- Justin Murphy sets the motion to approve the meeting minutes for the April TC Meeting as seen in PR [#1011](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1011).
- Thomas Schmidt seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.

## GitHub Issues & Pull Requests

- Issues [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812)
  - Thomas Schmidt presents the issue which details a change in the implementation of a mandartory test with the CSAF validation process that identifies and flags discrepancies in `product_identification_helper` to change the test from a mandatory test to a recommended test.
  - Omar supports the change.
  - Thomas Schmidt sets the motion to change the test detailed in Issue [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812) to NOT be mandatory, and be changed to a recommended test.
  - Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Issues [#884](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/884)
  - This was discussed during the TC meeting on 2025-03-26. A motion was set to include `license` as an optional field under `distribution` in the CSAF files.
  - Thomas read through the schema and realized it should shift one level to be a direct child of `/document`, and that the name of the field be changed to `license_expression`.
  - An SPDX license expression is a standardized, machine-readable way to specify the licensing terms that apply to a piece of software, especially when those terms may be complex or involve multiple licenses.
  - Thomas sets the motion to move the `license` field to the `/document` level and rename the field to be `license_expression`.
  - Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- PR [#991](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/991)
  - Thomas presents the PR which describes the process for the transition from CSAF v2.0 to v2.1.
  - The skeleton for the PR is in Issue [#843](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/843).
  - Thomas Schmidt sets the motion to accept the transition as stated in PR [#991]([)](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/991).
  - Stefan seconded. No discussion. No objection. Motion passed.
- Issue [#965](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/965) and PR #[1015](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1015)
  - Allow for other vulnerability identifiers. Idea is to allow for the addition of CNVD, EUVD, and GCVE.
  - Omar asks for clarification on GCVE and EUVD and if the TC sees these as lasting solutions?
  - Thomas clarifies that the EUVD is established by law in Europe and is not diverting from CVE, and GCVE came up in response to the funding problems encountered by CVE last month founded by CIRCL.
  - Omar cautions providing support for identifiers that do not have wide adoption or support.
  - Martin and Justin also caution against providing support as it is a bit premature to provide for other identifiers beyond CVE.
  - Sonny points out as a TC that we should be clear on what criteria an identifier system must meet to be included in the standard.
  - Omar suggests removing GCVE for the time being and we can reconsider down the road once we get a sense of adoption.
  - Thomas removed GCVE from PR [#1015](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1015) and Omar will take for action to notify the commenter about the TC decision.
  - Martin asked if we could make a mandatory rule that if an alternative vulnerability identifier is used, that a CVE is also used.
  - Thomas said that is unfortunately not possible as there might be a delay between the process and timing of one vulnerability identifier is released and when a CVE is released.
  - Thomas suggests that we could make the test a recommended test.
  - Omar, Martin, Thomas, and Feng discuss CVEs, CNAs, and the ability to reserve CVEs.
  - Martin and Feng encourage the TC not to move away from CVE as the identifier. While they understand the need for other identification mechanisms, if we move away from CVE it sets us back in standardization.
  - Omar mentions we as a committee do not want to set the wrong precedent.
  - Thomas presents two options:
    - One, we drop the topic and do not include support for alternate IDs, which could make things challenging for automation.
    - Two, we add the alternate IDs as stated in Issue [#965](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/965) and PR [#1015](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1015) and add an additional recommended test.
  - Christian suggests that we should avoid making CVE mandatory as well as we do not want to put the standard in a position where all CSAFs would be invalid.
  - Omar suggests we stay away from this topic since we as the TC are not a group of policy makers and we should shy away until things are normalized.
  - Omar suggest that we table the topic for discussion at a later time.
  - Omar suggests that we could have a ballot to gather the majority between the two options Thomas presented.
  - Thomas presents a third option that we not mention the specific identifiers in the standard, but have a separate register.
  - For the sake of time, Thomas suggests we table the topic and move on. Thomas closes PR [#1015](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1015).
  - No objections from TC to move on.
- PR [#1013](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1013)
  - Thomas presents the PR that is a requirement by IANA for ROLIE feed.
  - Thomas sets the motion to accept the IANA requirement for ROLIE specified in PR [#1013](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/1013).
  - Omar seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.

## Other Business
- Thomas suggests to the TC that we are in a position to move forward with publishing the Committee Specification Draft after resolving some merge conflicts.
- The TC discusses the Committee Specification Draft approval process for OASIS, with a ballot and public review.
- Thomas sets the motion to accept the current editor revision, including the conflict resolution pending merge conflicts and pull requests, and task the editors and chairs with working with the OASIS staff to promote the work item as a committee specification draft (CSD01) for CSAF v2.1.
- Omar and Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Thomas mentions to expect a ballot soon to request the formal consent from the TC members on CSD01 public review period.
- Thomas mentions that it will be great to have the public review open during the upcoming Annual FIRST Conference and aligns nicely with a change to publicize the public review.
- Omar echoes support for the nice alignment with the Annual FIRST Conference in Copenhagen and heading into Black Hat and DEFCON in the late summer.
- Omar also mentions get v2.1 (once approved) into ISO as well.
- Thomas Schmidt says we are required to submit to ISO as part of our submission for CSAF v2.0.
- The TC confirmed that no new features will be added to the current specification version for the standards track.
