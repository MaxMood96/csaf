- Thomas Schmidt seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.

## GitHub Issues & Pull Requests

- Issues [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812)
  - Thomas Schmidt presents the issue which details a change in the implementation of a mandartory test with the CSAF validation process that identifies and flags discrepancies in `product_identification_helper` to change the test from a mandatory test to a recommended test.
  - Omar supports the change.
  - Thomas Schmidt sets the motion to change the test detailed in Issue [#812](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/812) to NOT be mandatory, and be changed to a recommended test.
  - Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Issues [#884](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/884)
  - This was discussed during the TC meeting on 2025-03-26. A motion was set to include `license` as an optional field under `distribution` in the CSAF files.
  - Thomas read through the schema and realized it should shift one level to be a direct child of `/document`, and that the name of the field be changed to `license_expression`.
  - An SPDX license expression is a standardized, machine-readable way to specify the licensing terms that apply to a piece of software, especially when those terms may be complex or involve multiple licenses.
  - Thomas sets the motion to move the `license` field to the `/document` level and rename the field to be `license_expression`.
  - Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
