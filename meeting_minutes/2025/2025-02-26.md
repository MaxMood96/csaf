  - Subcommittee made up of a group of some of the most active OASIS members.
    - Stefan is part of the subcommittee.
  - Seems to be consensus on looking at tools that are not dependent on a specific vendor.
    - Not only for tools for the TCs, but all tools across OASIS for members support, budgeting, etc.
  - GitHub and Google Calendar are being considered as potential tools for TCs, with further exploration of other tools.
    - Aim is to be less disruptive to TC activities, and to embrace the tools that are already being utilized and working well for the TCs. 
- Omar asked TC to review meeting minutes for December (12/18) and January (1/29):
  - PR: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/869
  - PR: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/878
  - January meeting minutes to be updated via GitHub and motion will be done on Higher Logic platform to accept January meeting minutes.
- Thomas accounced that BSI is working on an open source tool to track quorum.
  - Currently under development.
  - Thomas will take the action to discuss with OASIS staff about the utlization of the tool.
- Stefan supports the idea of using BSI open source tool for calculating quorum.
- Stefan emphasizes the importance of these tools for TC processes to function properly (quorum, membership/participation, etc.).
- Omar moves to accept the Dember meeting minutes. Stefan seconds.
  - December meeting minutes accepted. PR: https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/869
  - Motion will be sent over email for January meeting minutes.

## GitHub Issues & Pull Requests

- Issue [#877](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/877)
  - Moving the test for additional items in CSAF documents to the schema for better code generation and clarity.
  - No objections. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
  - Thomas makes motion to accept the changes suggested in Issue [#877](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/877) and included in CSAF v2.1.
  - Christoph seconded. Motion passed.
- Issue [#876](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/876)
  - Thomas suggest that we should add a sentence to prohibit the use of client-side scripts to generate the listing as the data is static and this is a problem for text-based browsers and such entities that filter JavaScript at their firewall.
  - Omar clarifies this is not a change in the schema, but in the documentation.
  - Stefan suggest phrasing it without negation.
  - Thomas sets the motion to state that directory listings should be presented in HTML that is server generated as state in Issue [#876](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/876), notwithstanding any editorial changes that do not undermine the original intent.
  - Omar seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Issue [#863](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/863)
  - Christoph presents the issue to support product specific notes in vulnerabilities by adding `product_ids` and `group_ids` to note objects under vulnerability.
  - Thomas and Omar echo support for inclusion in CSAF v2.1
  - Omar moves to approve the proposal for all notes as stated in Issue [#863](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/863) and editors work on the specific wording.
  - Stefan seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Issue [#813](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/813)
  - Thomas suggests enforcing format validation in CSAF documents to ensure consistency.
  - Thomas sets the motion to enforce the format validation as stated in Issue [#813](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/813)
  - Omar seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Issue [#636](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/636)
  - Thomas suggests adding a test or a series of test enforcing the product version range rules.
  - Omar asks to clarify what specific validation would be enforcing?
  - Thomas describes how the standard uses `vers` and `vls`.
  - Feng mentions that it would be nice as a vendor to not have too many formats for versioning. Suggests using something similar to CVE JSON 5.
  - Thomas clarifies the rules are not new and already present in CSAF v2.0 (before CVE JSON 5). The CVE JSON 5 has some ambiguity in its definition, but it can be converted to a valid product version range in CSAF.
  - Thomas mentions the possibility of adding a tool to perform the conversion. 
    - Mentions complexities of CVE JSON 5 allowing git hashes as a version, and not being able to be automatically evaluatable.
  - Stefan suggests to steer toward strong automation.
  - Feng will put the CPE workaround schema for the issues TC members to reference.
  - Thomas suggests the editors prepare a PR and discuss the validation rules for enforcing product version ranges for review.
- Issue [#653](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/653)
  - Thomas suggests including the access control allow origin header as a distribution requirement in CSAF v2.1.
  - No questions or discussion.
  - Thomas sets a motion to include the access control allow origin header as a distribution requirement in CSAF v2.1 and as state in Issue [#653](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/653).
  - Stefan seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
