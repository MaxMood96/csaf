## Meeting Notes

- Omar announces end of formal voting for co-chairs, and welcomes Stefan and Justin as co-chairs for the OASIS CSAF TC.
  - Omar will check with OASIS Staff to update the OASIS CSAF landing page with updates of the co-chairs for the OASIS CSAF TC.
- Omar and Thomas announce that the CSAF website has a new draft being published.
  - We have a new technical stack, moving from Mobirise to Google platform.
  - Available at https://csaf.dev/
  - Christian suggests reorganizing the Open Source Tools page on the website, perhaps into categories. Points out some tools are just libraries and others are more "full tool sets".
  - Omar supports the idea of categories. Suggests could be divided into personas, such as a consumer or somebody that is actually writing a document or contributing to it.
  - Thomas points out the conformance targets and suggests first to change the technical stack and then to do the content work.
  - Omar sets the motion to accept this new framework to develop and maintain the website as it is shown in the framework.
  - Will transition to https://csaf.io/
  - Christian and Denny seconded.  No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Omar mentions the 2025 VulnCon conference coming up in April in Raleigh, NC. Presentations by Omar and Justin on updates to CSAF and OpenEoX.
- Thomas mentions that he and Justin will be doing a CSAF Workshop at VulnCon as well. 
- Thomas discusses the new tool is available for calculating quorum and voting rights and will be used for CSAF.
  - Thomas formally asks the TC whether we introduce the quorum tool for CSAF TC use in the meantime until there is a solution presented by OASIS.
  - Omar suggests the tool could be used by OASIS beyond just the CSAF TC, but for other TC's as well.
  - Omar sets a motion to accept the contribution of the quorom tool to use for calculating quorum and voting rights.
  - Justin and Denny seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
