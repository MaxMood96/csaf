## Meeting Notes

- Omar announces end of formal voting for co-chairs, and welcomes Stefan and Justin as co-chairs for the OASIS CSAF TC.
  - Omar will check with OASIS Staff to update the OASIS CSAF landing page with updates of the co-chairs for the OASIS CSAF TC.
- Omar and Thomas announce that the CSAF website has a new draft being published.
  - We have a new technical stack, moving from Mobirise to Google platform.
  - Available at https://csaf.dev/
  - Christian suggests reorganizing the Open Source Tools page on the website, perhaps into categories. Points out some tools are just libraries and others are more "full tool sets".
  - Omar supports the idea of categories. Suggests could be divided into personas, such as a consumer or somebody that is actually writing a document or contributing to it.
  - Thomas points out the conformance targets and suggests first to change the technical stack and then to do the content work.
  - Omar sets the motion to accept this new framework to develop and maintain the website as it is shown in the framework.
  - Will transition to https://csaf.io/
  - Christian and Denny seconded.  No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Omar mentions the 2025 VulnCon conference coming up in April in Raleigh, NC. Presentations by Omar and Justin on updates to CSAF and OpenEoX.
- Thomas mentions that he and Justin will be doing a CSAF Workshop at VulnCon as well. 
- Thomas discusses the new tool is available for calculating quorum and voting rights and will be used for CSAF.
  - Thomas formally asks the TC whether we introduce the quorum tool for CSAF TC use in the meantime until there is a solution presented by OASIS.
  - Omar suggests the tool could be used by OASIS beyond just the CSAF TC, but for other TC's as well.
  - Omar sets a motion to accept the contribution of the quorom tool to use for calculating quorum and voting rights.
  - Justin and Denny seconded. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.

## GitHub Issues & Pull Requests

- PR [#902](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/902)
  - Thomas has a few questions remaining re: CVSS v4.0 that he hopes to clarify at VulnCon with the FIRST CVSS SIG chair. Omar agrees to facilitate an introduction.
  - Thomas discusses the conversion rule for CVSS v4.0 from CSAF v2.0 to CSAF v2.1.
  - Thomas sets the motion to accept the conversion rule from CVSS v4.0 as stated in pull request [#902](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/902).
  - Justin seconded. No objections. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
- Issue [#884](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/884)
  - Thomas explains need to include a `license` field in not only the `provider-metadata.json`, but also the CSAF file itself.
  - Sonny asks if the declaration of the license would be mandatory or an optional field?
  - Thomas suggests to make it a "SHOULD" statement.
  - Omar says he does not like the suggestion of including `license` in a CSAF file, and should leave the licensing done in the reference to the CSAF file.
  - Thomas clarifies that is not about the license of the product, but a license of the data that is in the CSAF document.
  - Christian also suggests putting the licensing in the individual documents and not just `provider-metadata.json` since there is not a good way to jump fron CSAF file to the `provider-metadata.json`. Could be tricky to find the license if it is not specified in the file.
  - Christian asks would the existing legal disclaimer not suffice already although it might be easeier if is a dedicated field and maybe just an SPDX identifier or something like that might be easier.
  - Sonny asks would it be possible to split up the `legal_disclaimer` into multiple `legal_disclaimer` fields of certain types as an implementation option?
  - Thomas mentions that you can have multiple `legal_disclaimer` fields, such as one for "terms of use" or one like a "classic" legal disclaimer. Those are in the document nodes with a different `title`.
  - Thomas mentions the value of having the dedicated `license` field is for the purpose of machine-readability. The human readable licenses do not scale with automation.
  - Thomas mentions the BSI technical guidelines around using license identifiers and what to do if there is not an appropriate license identifier.
  - Sonny asks to clarify where the `license` field would be in the document.
  - Thomas specifies under "Distrubition" have a new property called `license`, and that property would hold the identifier.
  - Sonny asks will it be mandatory?
  - Thomas asks who would say that this information should be mandatory?
  - Omar highly suggests it should not be mandatory.
  - Thomas moves to add a `license` identifier under Distribution as a license identifier to CSAF v2.1. Omar modifies the motion to include that this is an optional field.
  - Omar seconded. No objections. No discussion, no objections, motion passed.
