## Meeting Notes

- Thomas Schmidt and Sonny discussed pros and cons of using SPDX license identifiers for CSAF v2.1 for the second rule under the prose of v2.1
  - Thomas expressed concerns about relying on a private organization's license database and Thomas will take the action to reach out to SPDX folks to get their perception of SPDX maintaining an official list of license identifiers.
  - While using this solution is not ideal, it is the best option at this time.
- BSI plans to provide tools for CSAF v2.1 but currently faces budget constraints.
  - Rust implementation is a top priority to enhance validation processes across languages.
  - Participants encouraged to reach out to Thomas if they want to contribute resources for CSAF tools development.
- Stefan indicates that there has been strong engagement, feedback, and interest in the CSAF standard based on the public review for CSAF v2.1 CSD-01.
  - TC Members agree this is reassuring to hear and demonstrates relevance for the standard.
- Thomas reviews the next steps in the process with public review. The July meeting will focus on presenting solutions, comment resolution and preparation for next phases in public review processes.
  - The editors will prepare for the next meeting the presenting of solutions and a comment resolution log.
  - With 30+ comments, this is a lot of work and so many of the motions will be done through email prior to next meeting.
  - Omar asked if TC members would want to push back the July meeting to perhaps give more time.
  - Thomas Schmidt and Stefan said that this would not be necessary to change the meetings dates and they can be flexible with how we use the meeting time.
- Thomas Schmidt announces the CSAF Community Days in calendar week 46 of 2025. More information will be coming soon about location, registration, CFP, etc.
- Thomas Schmidt to provide an update on the website and legal discussions with OASIS regarding BSI contribitions.
