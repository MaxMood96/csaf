## Meeting Notes

**Quorum was NOT reached.**

- OASIS-related Updates:
   - OpenEoX is a new TC aimed at standardizing the way End-of-Life (EOL) and End-of-Support (EOS) information is exchanged within the software and hardware industries. Covering both vendors and open-source maintainers, OpenEoX strives to provide a transparent, efficient, and unified approach to managing product lifecycles. More info at: https://openeox.org
   - AI Security Summit on Nov 30 (hybrid): https://aisecuritysummit.org . Discussions include the top AI threats and risks, AI vulnerability management and disclosure (CSAF plays a role here), challenges when monitoring AI implementations, upcoming regulations, AI Bill of Materials (AI BOMs), AI training environment security, and more.

- We discussed several [GitHub Issues Labeled for TC Discussion](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atc-discussion-needed). However, due to the absence of a quorum, these sessions were informal in nature. Despite this, we ensured that all discussions and recommendations were properly documented within each respective [GitHub issue](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atc-discussion-needed).
- Due to the holiday season and many on PTO, the next meeting will be held on January 31, 2024.
