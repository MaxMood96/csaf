- Justin – for all ICS advisories moving forward: in CSAF format, they are all converted and there are still human readable advisories.
  - They will be in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cisagov/csaf).
  - And a blog post to announce this; however, may be a delay as a federal employee but will try and get the blog post out asap.
  - Thomas –
    - Great to see that. CSAF is getting more people involved.
  - Tyler ahead of blog post announcement can we share with team.
  - Justin - please wait until the blog post comes out and will send an email the TC (and in GitHub too).
  - *addendum: Blog post is available at https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/transforming-vulnerability-management-cisa-adds-oasis-csaf-20-standard-ics-advisories*
    - Action items –
      - One task of editors is to convert FAQ under CSAF, and it has been merged with change in wording.
      - Merged by Stephen and can review in Markdown.
      - Guidance and FAQ added some parts TOP version 1. CSAF distribution.

- With no concerns or issues regarding pull request [#655](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/pull/655)
  - Thomas Schmidt set motion to accept text addition to guidance documents as given.
  - Write CSAF 2.1 will support version 2. TOP version 2.

  - Motion passed.

- Consider for CSAF – [#639](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/639)
  - With no concerns or issues regarding the above pull request #639,
  - Thomas Schmidt set motion for CSAF 2.1 and will register and include as stated by Stefan above.
  - Thomas Schaffer second motion.
  - Motion passed.

- Clarify that blocking on user-agents is not allowed pull request [#635](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/635).
  - Thomas Schmidt – can block be based on user agents or does it need a specific user agent for CSAF files? This restriction of a certain set could hinder the adoption of CSAF user agent. Suggested not having these restrictions.
  - With no concerns or issues regarding the above,
    - Thomas Schmidt set motion to add #635 a statement to 2.1 is not allowed and add statement to FAQ too.
    - Thomas Schaffer seconded the motion.
    - Motion passed.

- Mandate Access-Control-Allow Origin: * for files available in public to allow browser-based client [#653](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/653)
  - This issue is with CORS resource-sharing and includes data from a different domain in a course header to allow origin header.
  - Client application on GitHub, could not gather data from JavaScript.
  - Mandate all CSAF providers inclusion with their data.
  - Stefan said it is important to keep public.
  - Thomas Schmidt is not a big fan of this suggestion.
  - Mandate that everyone use in an insecure way is contradicting using “secure by design.”
  - Sonny agrees. Does not lead to increased risk and it’s public anyway.
  - Thomas Schmidt says it's important about public files, CND providers, mandate this special instruction, an additional burden to the provider and no automation part.
  - Just browser-based client and JavaScript in browsers only and not our main concern.
  - Stefan questioned how we could maintain this. It’s not really progress with automation.
  - Do not see as version 2.0 standard sends wrong message.
  - Not increasing or using automation. Pull it back from now revisit later.
    - Thomas Schmidt set motion to write a comment and label the issue CSAF 2.x and have a TC discussion needed and label to come back later.
    - Do not include proposal in 2.1 and look at for 2.X.
    - Thomas Schaffer seconds the motion.
    - Motion to hold off passed.

- Pull request [#647](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/647) team agreed to postpone discussion to check previous meeting minutes on decisions regarding the issue.

- Add new relationship to our bulk of relationship categories pull request [#631](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/csaf/issues/631).
  - The structure is a bit more complex but matches tools better and is an improvement.
  - Feng says schema could fail and it excluded certain versions in CPW screen.
  - Thomas will look into this again to determine if it would be an issue.
  - Take this at home and think about the issues over the next month and discuss at the next meeting.
