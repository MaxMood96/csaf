### Missing Date in Involvements

For each item in the list of involvements it MUST be tested that it includes the property `date`.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /vulnerabilities[]/involvements
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "involvements": [
        {
          "party": "vendor",
          "status": "in_progress"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> The list of involvements contains an item which does not contain the property `date`.
