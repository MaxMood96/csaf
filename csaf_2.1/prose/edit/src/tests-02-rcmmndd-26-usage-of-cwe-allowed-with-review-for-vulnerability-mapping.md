### Usage of CWE Allowed with Review for Vulnerability Mapping

For each item in the CWE array it MUST be tested that the vulnerability mapping is allowed without review.

> Reasoning: CWEs marked with a vulnerability mapping state of `Allowed-with-Review` should only be used if a thorough review was done.
> This test helps to flag such mappings which can be used to trigger processes that ensure the extra review, e.g. by a senior analyst.
>
> Note: The property `Usage` within the `MappingNotesType` was introduced in version `7.0` of the CWE schema definition.
> As a consequence, this information might not be available before CWE version `4.12`.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
      "cwes": [
        {
          "id": "CWE-1023",
          "name": "Incomplete Comparison with Missing Factors",
          "version": "4.13"
        }
      ]
```

> The usage of CWE-1023 is allowed with review as the "CWE entry is a Class and might have Base-level children that would be more appropriate". [cite](#CWE-1023)
