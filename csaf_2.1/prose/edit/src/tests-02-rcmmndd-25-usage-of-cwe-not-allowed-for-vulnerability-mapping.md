### Usage of CWE Not Allowed for Vulnerability Mapping

For each item in the CWE array it MUST be tested that the vulnerability mapping is allowed.

> Currently, this includes the two usage state `Allowed` and `Allowed-with-Review`.
>
> Note: The property `Usage` within the `MappingNotesType` was introduced in version `7.0` of the CWE schema definition.
> As a consequence, this information might not be available before CWE version `4.12`.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/cwes[]
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
      "cwes": [
        {
          "id": "CWE-20",
          "name": "Improper Input Validation",
          "version": "4.13"
        }
      ]
```

> The usage of CWE-20 is discouraged as "is commonly misused in low-information vulnerability reports when lower-level CWEs could be used instead, or when more details about the vulnerability are available" [cite](#CWE-20).
