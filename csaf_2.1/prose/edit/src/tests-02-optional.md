## Optional Tests

Optional tests SHOULD NOT fail at a valid CSAF document without a good reason. Failing such a test does not make the CSAF document invalid.
These tests may include information about features which are still supported but expected to be deprecated in a future version of CSAF.
A program MUST handle a test failure as a warning.
