### Build Metadata in Revision History

For each item in revision history it MUST be tested that `number` does not include build metadata.

The relevant path for this test is:

```
    /document/tracking/revision_history[]/number
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
    "revision_history": [
      {
        "date": "2023-08-23T10:00:00.000Z",
        "number": "1.0.0+exp.sha.ac00785",
        "summary": "Initial version."
      }
    ]
```

> The revision history contains an item which has a `number` that includes the build metadata `+exp.sha.ac00785`.
