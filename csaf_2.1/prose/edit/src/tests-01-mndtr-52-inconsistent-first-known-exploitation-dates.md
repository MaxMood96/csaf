### Inconsistent First Known Exploitation Dates

For each First Known Exploitation Dates item, it MUST be tested that the values of its `date` and `exploitation_date` properties are both earlier than
or equal to the `date` of the newest item of the `revision_history` if the document status is `final` or `interim`.
As the timestamps might use different timezones, the sorting MUST take timezones into account.

The relevant paths for this test are:

```
  /vulnerabilities[]/first_known_exploitation_dates[]/date
  /vulnerabilities[]/first_known_exploitation_dates[]/exploitation_date
```

*Example 1 (which fails the test):*

```
  "document": {
    // ...
    "tracking": {
      // ...
      "revision_history": [
        {
          "date": "2024-01-24T10:00:00.000Z",
          "number": "1",
          "summary": "Initial version."
        }
      ],
      "status": "final",
      // ...
    }
  },
  // ...
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "first_known_exploitation_dates": [
        {
          "date": "2024-01-24T13:00:00.000Z",
          "exploitation_date": "2024-01-24T12:34:56.789Z",
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
```

> The document is in status `final` but the values of the properties `date` and `exploitation_date` of the First Known Exploitation Dates item are
> newer than the `date` of newest item in the `revision_history`.
